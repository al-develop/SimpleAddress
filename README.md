# SimpleAddress
simple adress book, for practising c++ with Qt

it just should be able to do CRUD on Contact information, with simple metadata (just one class).
Maybe Database support (SQLite) will be added later, but for the beginning, I just plan to store Data in a XML file.
This project is just for practise.
